📚 Bookstore Purchase Calculator

📝 Description
This project is a bookstore purchase calculator, developed for ICE Task 1 at Rosebank College. It helps customers calculate their total book purchase cost, apply discounts, and generate a receipt. The program collects book titles and prices, applies a 10% discount if the total exceeds R500, and displays a detailed receipt. Built using Java and Scanner for user input. 🚀

🚀 Features:
✔️ Ask for the number of books a customer wants to buy.
✔️ Collect book titles and prices.
✔️ Calculate the total cost of all books.
✔️ Apply a 10% discount if the total is above R500.
✔️ Display a receipt with book details and the total price before and after the discount.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Java
Scanner (for user input)
TreeMap (to store books and prices)

Challenges faced:

✔️Capturing only the first word of a book title instead of the full name.
✔️Dealing with input mismatches when entering prices.
